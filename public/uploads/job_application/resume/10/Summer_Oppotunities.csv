"American Legion Auxiliary Bluebonnet Girls State","Summer Opportunity ","The Girls State program in Texas has been one of constant improvement and growth. The number of participants has grown from 94 to over 500. The progress of Girls State in Texas could not have been accomplished if it had not been for the pioneers of Bluebonnet Girls State; the full cooperation and encouragement of the Department Presidents of the American Legion Auxiliary; former directors, members and chairmen of the Girls State Committee; the press, radio and television; school and state officials; interested individuals; most of all the local units who sponsor girls; and last but not least, the citizens.
 

 One of Girls State’s most influential pioneers was Frances Goff who began working with Girls State in 1947. She used her considerable experience in state government to shape the program as Director from 1952 until 1994.
 

 During past sessions of Girls State, citizens have been privileged to hear many outstanding speakers including: then Governor George W. Bush, former Presidents George Bush and Lyndon Baines Johnson, First Lady Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson and Miss Barbara Jordan. Former Girls State citizens Gov. Ann W. Richards, Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn, Judge Bea Ann Smith and others have also returned to the program as guest speakers.

"Adelante Family Scholars","Summer Opportunity ","Students selected for the program will receive a full scholarship, including course tuition, housing and dining, residential and student life fees, and the cost of travel to and from campus.
 I am so grateful for this experience. The Neubauer Family Adelante Summer Scholars program truly changed my life for the better. I feel so prepared to go out into my community and the world and make a real difference.
 This was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I found value in everything I did and learned: becoming accustomed to the college lifestyle, doing college level work, developing life-long (hopefully) friendships, learning to navigate public transportation, exploring Chicago, learning more about the college application process. This was an experience that I will treasure forever.
 The sense of community that college brings. The other students in the Neubauer Family Adelante Summer Scholars program honestly became like a family to me - there was always someone to spend time with in the lounge, always someone ready to get a shake at Medici's with you, always a group ready to go to salsa. I thought college was more isolating than high school, but it really is not. Here at UChicago I felt closer to my fellow Neubauers then most of my peers back at home. I love the sense of community on campus.
 The most important thing that I am coming away with is that I am beyond excited to go to college and major in the sciences. I was passionate before, but UChicago has only impassioned me more. I can't wait to delve into new ideas and concepts and get a new perspective on the world. Liberal arts college is definitely for me. I have a lot of interests and I want to satisfy all of them; however, I am not sure that my curiosity will ever be satiated.
 The most important thing I can take away from this program is the adventurous spirit I cultivated. Whether it was making a bold comment in class discussion or going on a downtown Chicago adventure or dancing full out in a salsa class, I definitely got out of my comfort zone at UChicago.","University of Chicago","12","Free","Illinois","$0.00","6/20/2021","7/10/2021","2/26/2021","Alejandra","Campos","","acampos93@UCHICAGO.EDU","http://summer.uchicago.edu/high-school/neubauer-summer-scholars","Law Government and Social Studies","","","","","","","",""

Students will also explore threats to coastal and marine resources. Field studies take place at a salt marsh, sandy beach, rocky shore, and on open water. The High School Program runs Monday through Friday from August 3-14, 2015. Maximum group size is 20.
 Building on knowledge learned inл_Chondrus, Pagurusл_students will deepen their knowledge of local coastal ecology and habitats through student-led field investigation. Staff will facilitate student inquiry and research in topics of their own choosing.л_ Ample access to field sites for data collection will be provided, as well as guidance in developing sound research questions, methodologies, analyzing data, and presenting results. The High School Program runs Monday through Friday from August 3-14, 2015.л_It is possible that Pagurus students will return to field sites previously visited (which is what scientists do!) Pagurus students will play a role in explaining fieldwork protocols to Chondrus students, but they will also have some separate opportunities presented at a level that assumes their prior knowledge and advanced interest in marine science.
 In 2015, with support from the MSC_Сйs Helmuth Lab, students in COSA Pagurus partnered with girls from the Beach Sisters program to produce an interactive virtual tour of the Forest River Conservation Area in Salem. л_Students conducted field data and collected other assets to annotate the _СТcanvas_Сќ of several high resolution images. л_The final product can be viewed here, and you can read a news article about it here.

 Camp Goals / Overview The goal of Camp Psych is to provide a window into how psychological science works. What are some of the major questions investigated by psychologists? Campers will get hands-on experiences that introduce them to research in psychology in a fun, challenging, and engaging environment. Campers will not simply learn about cutting edge issues and research in psychology; they will engage in research themselves. Perfect for students interested in psychology, this camp gives students an insider view of the field as well as preparation for college studies.
 Camp Directors Drs. Brian P. Meier and Abigail A. Scholer, social psychologists with extensive experience in psychological research and teaching, are the directors of Camp Psych. Drs. Meier and Scholer have published over 70 papers in prestigious journals in psychology, regularly present at major psychological conferences, and have received grants, awards, and fellowships for both teaching and research. Brian Meier received both his B.S. and Ph.D. from North Dakota State University and is now an Associate Professor at Gettysburg College. Abigail Scholer, an alumna of Gettysburg College ('00), went on to receive her Ph.D. from Columbia University and is now an Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo. Both are thrilled to team up to direct Camp Psych at Gettysburg College. Their passion for psychology is infectious. Their classes are structured so that students are not only introduced to the fundamentals of psychological research methods but also get hands-on experience and opportunities to apply skills to real-world issues.
 Role of RAs/TAs Campers will live in a college residence hall with resident advisors, psychology majors at Gettysburg College. Resident advisors are selected based on their expertise in psychology and their maturity and experience. Resident advisors will work with students in and outside of class to support the goals of the camp and all aspects of the campers' experiences.
 Details at a Glance Where: Gettysburg College Campus When: June 26-July 1, 2016 How Much: $1,250 for lodging, meals, and activities Who: Rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors Application Deadline: Applications for the 2016 camp will open in December or January. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning in January until the camp is full. We strongly encourage campers to apply early; your chances of being admitted to the camp are higher if you apply early. However, we do receive applications from many more qualified applicants than we can admit to our camp. Submitting an application does not guarantee acceptance. In making admissions decisions, we carefully review applicant statements and often contact teacher references. We will notify applicants as soon as possible after a decision has been made, but we note that it may take us several weeks after an application has been submitted to send a notification.

"Young Writers Workshop","Summer Opportunity ","The Kenyon Review Young Writers Workshop
 Young Writers is an intensive two-week workshop for intellectually curious, motivated high-school students who value writing. Our goal is to help students develop their creative and critical abilities with language_СУto become better, more productive writers and more insightful thinkers. For more than nineteen years, Young Writers has provided a lively, supportive environment where students can stretch their talents, discover new strengths, and challenge themselves in the company of peers who share their interests.
 Young Writers takes place at Kenyon College, a leading liberal arts college renowned for its tradition of literary study. The program is sponsored by The Kenyon Review, one of the country_Сйs preeminent literary magazines.
 Writers discover what they want to say_СУtheir ideas, images, narrative direction_СУin the act of writing (and rewriting). Writing, thinking, and imagining, in other words, are part of the same creative process. Thus, at Young Writers, students write to explore ideas, then develop those ideas through further writing. Because good writers are also avid readers, students read short stories, poems, and essays, which they discuss, write about, and use as inspiration for their own work.
 Workshop groups (with no more than thirteen students in each group) meet for five hours a day. In addition to freewriting exercises and responses to _СТprompts,_Сќ students write stories, poetry, personal narratives, dialogues, reflective passages, and experimental pieces. They also use writing to explore, creatively and analytically, short works by established authors. While traditional expository essays are not assigned (nor is any work at Young Writers graded), a number of our exercises help students approach difficult texts, formulating their own questions and ideas_СУskills that will serve them well in writing papers for school and college.
 Sharing and discussion of participants_Сй work is a central part of the workshop. In leading discussions, instructors emphasize techniques for responding to work in ways that will help the writer recognize his or her strengths, potential, and avenues for productive revision. Instructors also meet with each student in individual conferences.
 Students especially value the opportunity to meet other talented writers and make new friends from all over the country. Workshop sessions are complemented by informal interchange during free time as well as by a series of public readings by visiting poets, fiction writers, and essayists. Several public sessions are reserved for Young Writers_СУevery student reads his or her work at one of these special occasions. In this atmosphere of high energy and camaraderie, students create their own community, one that persists long after the program has ended.
 Nestled among rolling hills in the village of Gambier, the Kenyon campus is known for its striking beauty. Its historic buildings and shaded lawns have nurtured excellent writers for generations. Students have full access to College recreational facilities, including basketball and tennis courts and a swimming pool. Weekend activities include social events and field trips.
 Young Writers is a two-week residential program. The total cost, including tuition, accommodations, all meals, and activities, is $2,375.
 Kenyon is committed to socioeconomic diversity, and some scholarship aid is available for students who demonstrate financial need as part of their application. To apply for scholarship aid, please check the box on the application form and send in the scholarship application form by March 1st.
 In addition to the online application form, each student must also submit a brief story or essay (not to exceed 300 words) that illustrates why he or she is interested in participating in the Young Writers program and what he or she might contribute to it. A teacher_Сйs letter of recommendation, a high school transcript, and an optional financial aid application must also be postmarked and/or submitted electronically no later than March 1st.

"Bard College at Simon's Rock Young Writers Workshop","Summer Opportunity ","In the summer of 1983 Simon’s Rock began offering a three-week writing workshop for high school students modeled after the innovative three-week Workshop in Language and Thinking required of all entering students at Bard College. We are now part of the National Writing and Thinking Network, the largest consortium of summer writing programs in the country. Each year 84 academically motivated students are chosen to participate in the Simon's Rock program. Former participants have gone on to such colleges as Amherst, Bard, Harvard, Haverford, Kenyon, Princeton, Simon's Rock, Smith, Williams, and Yale.
 

 Male and female student smiling in classUnlike conventional workshops in expository and creative writing, Simon’s Rock’s focuses on using informal, playful, expressive writing as a way to strengthen skills of language and thinking. Out of these informal writing activities, using techniques of peer response, students develop more polished pieces, ranging from personal narratives to stories, poems, and exploratory essays.
 

 The workshop sections are small (12 students). This allows for individual attention to each student and helps to foster the sense of belonging to a supportive learning community in which students can feel comfortable exploring new directions in their writing and thinking. Trusting one's own language and voice, learning to think for oneself and in collaboration with others— these are the qualities and skills that the workshop strives to develop
 

 Each weekday consists of three 90-minute sessions organized as writing and discussion seminars. Workshop leaders write with their students, and there is frequent sharing of this informal writing, both in small groups and in the class as a whole. Discussions of assigned readings—mostly contemporary poems, stories, and essays—is informal and speculative. The emphasis isn't on arriving at a “correct answer” but on exploring various ideas about what a text is saying. The texts also frequently serve as starting points and models for students’ own creative writing exercises. These daily activities are complemented by evening assignments in reading, revising, and journal writing.
 

 Each week students develop a portfolio of “works in progress” and then meet individually with their workshop leader to discuss what they have written. Rather than evaluation, these meetings focus on what the writer is trying to do in his or her writing and how best to accomplish these goals. By becoming more conscious of their choices and strategies, students develop the intellectual autonomy expected of them as they prepare for college.
 

 Students live on campus in the college’s dormitories, along with adults who are members of the Simon's Rock student life staff. Aside from quiet hours and a curfew, students are free to organize their time in ways that fit their particular needs, whether that means preparing for the next day's class, socializing with friends, participating in a recreational activity, or attending an off-campus cultural event.
 

 All faculty are experienced teachers and writers with a special interest in the theory and practice of the nationally recognized Bard College Institute for Writing and Thinking. They are selected for the Simon’s Rock workshop because of their record of teaching excellence and their familiarity with the needs and abilities of younger writers.","Bard College","10,11,12","Yes","Massachusetts","$3,025.00","7/12/2021","8/1/2021","4/1/2021","Jamie","Hutchinson","413-528-7231","jamieh@simons-rock.edu","https://simons-rock.edu/academics/beyond-the-classroom/young-writers-workshop/index.php","Technology Math and Engineering","","","","","","","",""

 Academic Challenge Through this advanced course in Service, Leadership & Community Transformation, students are challenged to learn in new ways and apply their skills in real-world settings. Class groups of approximately 15 students, along with an experienced instructor, engage in an innovative curriculum that integrates theory and practice. Classroom learning is hands-on. In addition to readings and written assignments, our instructors utilize interactive exercises, simulations, independent and small group projects, and facilitated dialogue and debate. Students develop their critical thinking skills by examining and defending their own ideas and learning to understand and appreciate the perspectives of others. Meaningful Service At CLI, students experience service like never before _СР service that not only strikes a chord in the moment, but resonates throughout their time at CLI and for years to come. Year after year, students report that the service experiences are the most eye-opening element of the program. The city becomes_СЊa classroom, and the issues communities_СЊ are facing become a text. Students are able_СЊto connect with people, hear their stories_СЊand gain an understanding of the issues that readings and assignments alone can_Сйt provide. Several times a week, in their class groups, students engage in service projects that span neighborhoods, organizations and approaches to addressing social problems. During a typical project, students might serve a meal to someone who is hungry, run activities at a youth center, or conduct outreach for a neighborhood improvement organization. All service experiences are coordinated_СЊand facilitated by CLI staff, who create a supportive environment where students feel safe to participate in activities they may have never attempted before. Speakers & SeminarsA series of all-campus guest speakers allows students to hear from top government, business and nonprofit leaders about their experiences, perspectives and advice for young people wanting to create change. In addition, students have an opportunity to explore special topics in leadership and social change through periodic mini-workshops that complement the curriculum and are drawn from the diverse expertise of CLI staff. Leadership DevelopmentStudent leadership is a core value of CLI. Staff provide tools for students to move beyond participating in the program to taking ownership of their learning and their residential experience. In the process, students hone their communication and interpersonal skills and gain practice in teamwork and problem solving. Over the course of the program, students identify a need in their neighborhood or school community and create a plan to address it, applying the tools they learned in the course to an area of personal interest. Students report that their CLI experience provides rich material for college admissions essays, job and internship interviews_СЊand future academic assignments. Most importantly, students build their proficiency as active, engaged citizens and leave the program inspired and empowered to create positive change.
 Participants may be eligible for high school creditл_andл_between 25 and 100 hours of service-learning creditл_towards school or extracurricular requirements. Students interested in pursuing credit should discuss this option with school officials before applying to the program. Students or families should contact the academic counselor, registrar, principal or other school administrator responsible for granting credit at the student's academic-year school. You may download a sample syllabus toл_share with school officials prior to the program. Additionally, let school officials know that you will be able to document your completion of the course with a detailed evaluation from the instructor, certification of service hours, and a transcript or certificate of completion. Often a school district will require a certain number of contact hours to qualify for credit. The Civic Leadership Institute provides 100 contact hours with the discipline. The acceptance of credit at a student's academic-year school depends on the student's successful completion of the course and the school's institutional policy about the recognition of credit from outside institutions. While successful completion of a course indicates that a student has mastered the material covered, we cannot guarantee that the academic-year school will acknowledge or accept the credit earned. Evaluations & Transcripts All students receive a narrative evaluation after completion of the course. The evaluation provides feedback on the student_Сйs achievements in the course and outlines areas for further growth. Students also receive certification of service hours, and an official transcript or certificate of completion. School officials typically require copies of these materials to grant proper credit. Many students also choose to include them in their college applications. Evaluation materials are sent to families (and schools, if requested) approximately six weeks following the completion of the program. CEP is also happy to complete any specific forms required for students to earn service hours; contact our office for assistance with this.
 Community & College Life CLI offers an opportunity for students to experience a true living-learning community. Students and staff live on a top college campus in an exciting city. In diverse class and residential groups, students form strong bonds with like-minded peers from across the country and around the world. Staff are invested in the success of every student, and help build a safe and supportive environment for growth and self-discovery. All Civic Leadership Institute participants live in one residence hall on campus, under the supervision of specially trained residential staff. Each resident assistant (RA) is responsible for a group of approximately 15 students. Most students are assigned to double rooms, but on occasion, students are assigned to singles or triples. Bathrooms are shared. The residence hall has defined boundaries for male and female students; cross-hall visitation is not permitted. Students eat with residential staff and other members of the university community in a dining hall on campus. Students also have limited access to other campus facilities, including libraries, computer labs and athletic fields. Recreation & FunJust as the city becomes a classroom, it also becomes a place to experience cultural and recreational opportunities outside of class. Our residential staff plan and facilitate a wide range of engaging activities that suit the varied interests of our students. An afternoon might be spent playing soccer, exploring the new exhibit at an art museum, checking out the local farmers_Сй market or cloud watching at the park. Students also have the option of signing out in pairs or small groups to visit sites close to campus, such as local shops, bookstores and cafes. When students need a break, they can relax in the dorms, unwind and talk with friends. Weekends are a chance to explore the city and engage in all-campus fun, with dances, talent shows, scavenger hunts and the like. Through each unforgettable activity, students connect with new and often lifelong friends.
 The safety of program participants is paramount at all times. We take careful steps to ensure the well-being of our students, including: Hiring Experienced Staff MembersOur staff is a talented group of educators brought together by their commitment to teaching highly able young people about civic engagement and social responsibility. Our instructional staff are typically outstanding teachers from secondary schools or universities, graduate students or youth development professionals with expertise in service-learning. Our residential staff are typically college graduates working in the education or nonprofit fields or junior- or senior-level undergraduates with a background in residential life. All staff are selected through a highly competitive process that weighs such factors as academic background, service-learning experience and experience working with youth in a residential setting. The process also includes a criminal background check. Alumni consistently report that one of the best aspects of the program is the quality of the staff teams. Working with Established & Well-Respected Host Agenciesл_ We work closely with host organizations to provide safe volunteer and learning environments. Host agencies orient students to the communities and activities they will be engaged in and outline precautions students can take to minimize risk and help ensure the safety and well-being of all group members. Providing Careful Supervisionл_ While students are ultimately responsible for their own conduct, our trained staff teams work together to provide clear guidelines and careful supervision. Each group of approximately 15 students is supervised by an instructor and teaching assistant during class time and field experiences, and by the residential staff during evening and weekend hours. Administrative staff are also on site at all times to provide support and supervision.л_л_ Requiring a High Standard of Student Conduct Our programs are highly structured and operate with a strict set of rules regarding campus and community boundaries and appropriate staff supervision. These rules help to ensure the well-being of our students and staff, and all students who attend must be committed to respecting them. Students and families are asked to review our Honor Code so thatл_all participants are aware of the program's expectations and their personal responsibility to contribute to a positive living and learning environment.л_ Safeguarding Student Healthл_ Administrative staff keep health information about each participant on hand at all times and are available to screen student medical concerns and provide first aid. Students who become ill or injured are taken to walk-in clinics or emergency rooms for treatment. Families are responsible for all health care costs incurred by their children during the program. Ensuring Emergency PreparednessWe are committed to ensuring the highest level of preparedness for all types of emergencies. Creating and maintaining a safe and secure program environment is a responsibility shared by administrators, staff and students. Administrators organize service experiences and plan travel routes with an eye to safety and supervision. Staff monitor weather conditions and alter outdoor program activities in the event of inclement conditions. Staff are trained on fire, weather emergency, and evacuation plans and protocols and prepared to manage emergency situations. Finally, students are oriented to ways they can help ensure their own and their fellow group members' safety and well-being. For more information about how we manage Internet use and student privacy, as well as discrimination, disabilities and sexual harassment, please review CTD's Policy Statements.

"The Brown Leadership Institute","Summer Opportunity ","The Brown Leadership Institute
 It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the enormity and complexity of the many challenges facing the world today. Problems such as environmental destruction, health crisis, wars, poverty, economic uncertainty, and social inequality demand the attention of every member of our global community.л_ But _СТto be the change we wish to see in the world,_Сќ we must start with ourselves, by questioning our assumptions, expanding our knowledge, and changing our behavior.
 Leadership Institute courses can help you rise to all of these challenges, by creating a learning environment that encourages exploration, discussion, and personal growth.
 We believe that informed and engaged youth can make a positive difference in the world; thus our mission is to help students develop and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with effective and socially responsible leadership.
 Students develop knowledge and understanding of complex issues through case studies, discussions, group projects, field trips, simulations, and debates. Student learning is stimulated by creative curricula, engaging faculty, and peers from around the world. Last year, we had students from 28 different countries and from around the U.S.л_Engagement with diverse perspectives is key to nuanced understanding of global problems and complex ideas.
 Students are housed in the same residence hall and have the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships with one another both within and outside of the classroom. Additionally, undergraduate Leadership Fellows serve as both Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the classroom and Resident Advisors (RAs) in the Residence Hall providing students with consistent and caring guidance throughout the program.
 Students will learn and apply the Social Change Model of Leadership Development in academic and co-curricular settings. Through engaging workshops, reflection activities, and an outdoor Challenge Course, students develop and practice leadership skills, such as public speaking, interpersonal communication, problem solving, conflict resolution, and teamwork.
 But what happens after you leave Brown? How will you respond to the needs of your neighbors, your community, and the world? All of us share a civic responsibility to both understand complex social issues and apply what we know in service to others. During your course, instructors and peers help students develop an Action Plan focused on a pressing issue that they care about.л_Students develop these plans while they are here in the summer, present their ideas to their peers, and then work on the project when they return home. Leadership alumni return to their communities as part of a network of socially responsible leaders.л_Review student plans in our digital Action Plan library which contains examples of the work our students have done in the past.
 The Leadership Institute is designed for highly motivated and intellectually curious students who are interested in social issues.

"Introduction to Architecture ","Summer Opportunity ","Introduction to Architecture is a rigorous six-week program that introduces high school and college students to architectural ideas, principles, and methods of exploring architectural problems in a studio setting. In ARCH 1300, you’ll attend lectures and workshops exploring architectural principles including composition, history, preservation, landscape architecture, planning, and urban design. In ARCH 1110, you'll put into practice what you’ve learned in the lectures as you develop skills in freehand drawing, architectural drawing, and model making, and experiment with software programs and emerging technologies. You'll also work on a series of design projects culminating in a final architectural proposition. The program incorporates studio critiques by teaching associates, and formal reviews by faculty and guest critics. Intensive individual instruction, small design seminars and discussion groups, and frequent progress reviews will prepare you for your final project presentation and portfolio review. No specialized knowledge is needed, beyond a serious interest in architectural design. (College students must register for ARCH 1110 and 1300 through Cornell University Summer Session.) This program requires a design tool kit at an additional cost of approximately $400, as well as the purchase of art supplies as required.","Cornell University - School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions","11,12","Yes","New York","$9,120.00","6/22/0201","8/4/2021","6/1/2021","Cornell","University","607-255-6203","summer_college@cornell.edu","https://www.sce.cornell.edu/sc/programs/index.php?v=178","Arts Design and Communication","","","","","","","",""
